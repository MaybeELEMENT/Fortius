## What you need to do to make your own Operating System that is Fortius based:
> ### Always credit Fortius from Your OS that based with Fortius, which is a Fortius Distribution

The code from scratch is made by M.L Pace, github of his [OS Project](https://github.com/mell-o-tron/MellOs). FortiusOS recoded alot by me, so its easier to understand & customize by public.
